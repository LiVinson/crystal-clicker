# Crystal-Clicker

A fun browser game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

Each game a number is randomly chosen and displayed. Users have to click the correct combination of crystals to match the chosen number. Each game, the random number chosen resets as does the value of each crystal when clicked. The game is over when the user is able to match the number to guess, or goes over. Wins and losses are tracked throughout the session.
