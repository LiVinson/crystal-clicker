//Declare variables:

var total = 0;
var wins = 0;
var losses = 0;
var randomNumber
 

//When page starts up, generates a new number
    //Set random number = (19 -120)

//Assigns value to each crystal (1 - 12)


//Total starts at 0, and then increases by the value of the crystal clicked

//After each click, runs a test:


//if total number = random number: end game/restart

//if total number > random number: end game/restart
